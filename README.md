# Bracketcode_bot


This is a Telegram bot that realises the idea of Bracket code. It has been proposed by Ilya M. Sheinin in a private Telegram chat. Encoding text with simple brackets can be both fun and stealty. 

This bot is based on [pyTelegramBotAPI](https://github.com/eternnoir/pyTelegramBotAPI) which is probably the best Python implementation of [Telegram Bot API](https://core.telegram.org/bots/api).
